A detailed approach makes Charlie a great fit in the corporate world.
Charlie joined Miles Davison in 1982 and became a partner in 1984.

JARED WIEBE
PARTNER/ Family Law

Jared provides support for families when they need it the most.
Jared’s experience in family law has taught him many lessons, but the lesson that continues to guide his practice most is that the needs of the children must be put first. It’s why he’ll always do his utmost to help clients reach a settlement, reducing the stress of litigation on all parties. Jared also places great importance on keeping his clients knowledgeable and informed of their options.

That philosophy, in conjunction with training as a mediator and a perpetually level head, makes him an incredible asset for families in stressful situations. Jared uses his skills and compassionate nature to help diffuse tense situations, allowing all parties to address sensitive matters with clarity, calmness and a focus on protecting children and assets. He has experience resolving all manner of disputes, from division of matrimonial property, custody and access to support payments. Although his focus is always on negotiating a settlement instead of heading to court, Jared is also an excellent litigator and has appeared at all levels of court in Alberta.

Being married with five children has greatly increased Jared's insight into family relationships and has honed his ability to help his clients manage issues related to the family. When Jared’s not serving his clients, he volunteers as a youth leader for the LDS church and plays in a band that performs at an annual Calgary lawyer’s charity battle of the bands.
